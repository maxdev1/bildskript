Basic structures:

	freq signal				takes frequency divider at #0, writes 1 to #1 on each tick
	
	init signal				writes 1 to #1 when
								a) set global, and program starts
								b) set in function, and function starts
						
	comms					are ignored
	
	var						stores a value. when true is written to #1, the stored value
							is written to #2. when a value is written to #0, the stored
							value is changed to that value
					
	if						if true is written to #0, writes 1 to #1, else writes 1 to #2
	
	tapswitch				outputs 1 to #0 when clicked
	
	decider					if true is written to #2, the value written to #1 is written to #0
					
	bitwise/math			applies the operand to the input values (two-pinned side)
							and writes the result to the output (one-pinned side)
	
	logical					applies the operand to the input values (opposite-sided pins)
							and writes the result to the output (remaining side)
							
	inc/dec					increments/decrements the incoming value and writes it to the output


Chips (functions):

	identified chip			groups the layout of a chip. pixels in the top left box are used to
							identify the function when including it
	
	func calls				calls the function matching the pixel layout once a value is written to start
